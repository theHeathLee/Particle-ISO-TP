# Particle-ISO-TP
ISO-TP Library for Particle devices


This project is a rebuilt version of [lishen2 isotp-c](https://github.com/lishen2/isotp-c), to work out of the box with Particle devices. That code was inspired by [openxc isotp-c](https://github.com/openxc/isotp-c), but the code has been completely re-written.
